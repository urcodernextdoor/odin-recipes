<h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken tenderloins</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>4 wedges fresh lemon (optional)</li>
     </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
          <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C) according to manufacturerâ€™s directions.</li>
          <li>Add cumin, coriander, pepper, garlic powder, and salt to a small bowl, and stir until well combined. Pat the tenders dry with a paper towel, drizzle tenders with olive oil, and rub both sides, pressing down, with the spice mixture until well coated with oil and spices.</li>
          <li>Place tenders in a single layer in the air fryer basket, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, flipping halfway through. If using a meat thermometer to check for doneness, internal temperature should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) in the thickest part. Depending on the brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches, and timing may vary.</li>
          <li>Remove from the air fryer, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve with a wedge of lemon.</li>
     </ol>
